## Technologies used :  Google BigQuery , Python
                     
### Thesis - Datasetes and algorithm to compute distances between ranked non-conjoint list 

* Books text downloaded from http://www.gutenberg.org :blue_book:

* Text was splitted into chapters using https://github.com/JonathanReeve/chapterize
Chapterize is now on PyPi, installable with pip. You can install it with:

        sudo pip3 install chapterize

* Text manipulation (tokenize,stemming,POS tagging) performed by https://github.com/hagitbenshoshan/text_distance/blob/master/tokenize_stem_pos.py
